Protecting our environment and peopleÂ´s wellbeing through innovative waste treatment, recycling and cleaning techniques is also one of our main characteristics. We are involved in projects at governmental levels, where we have been called in to study and give solutions to the waste contamination problems that many countries suffer at landfills levels. We are able to positively resolve such problems by the deployment of our technology and services, not only creating a final solution to the country itself, but allowing a new potential industry to grow that will take care of the environment and people.
